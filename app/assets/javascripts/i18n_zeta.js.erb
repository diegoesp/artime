/**
 * Internationalization module for the reference implementation
 *
 * It uses both the Rails i18n framework and the i18n-js framework (https://github.com/fnando/i18n-js) for
 * a consistent server and client i18n implementation.
 *
 * Include logic here to determine the correct localization for the resource files. Options are as follows:
 *
 * 1) Based on the referenced domain: This is the recommended implementation. It allows to automatically determines 
 * the language and plays well with URL copying and pasting.
 * 2) Session based language choice: It should be implemented based on choice of the user and saved as a personal 
 * preference. Can be set using this module.
