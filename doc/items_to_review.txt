- Project: Hours planned should be different to hours budgeted
- Project: why do we need a code for the project ? there's already a numeric id
- Client: should we use default scopes ?
- Client / User: should we use scoped models per mother model or children model ?
- Projects search screen: I took out the date from and date to parameters
- We're missing a client management screen
- Huge list of CSS on vendor => Have to include them in the application.rb
- Project: Dashboard + active + others fields... maybe too complex ?
