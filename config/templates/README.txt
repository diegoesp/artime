This folder contains templates for configuration files. The concrete implementation of these
files should not be pushed to the repository.

Whenever you want to implement these files, copy them to the config directory and remove the
".template" text from the name when it does apply.

You can also find many shell scripts either to deploy or set up your configuration environment.
